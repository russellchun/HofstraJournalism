Overview
JRNL080 is an advanced course in online journalism. Students explore methods of storytelling for the Web using various media and strategies, while examining ethical and legal issues in online journalism. Practical skills include leveraging social media for story sources and personal branding, and to effectively using audio, visuals, text, and data to create compelling stories for the news. This course requires original reporting, writing, and media production for the public-facing news site, The Long Island Report at LongIslandReport.org. You will function as individual reporters and as teams, and your professor will act as your editor and publisher. Only the best and most polished stories will be considered for publication on The Long Island Report.
This course expands upon the basic skills of reporting, writing, and multimedia development taught in earlier journalism classes. It is designed to strengthen your skills for a career in online journalism or to prepare you for a deeper examination of online video, audio, data, interactivity, or social media. While students are expected to enter this class already able to identify a news story, pitch it, report it, and write with clarity and accuracy in AP style, we will do brief reviews of the various technology  and techniques.

•	Students will implement design and construction of Web sites.

Being a journalist

Curiosity is essential to good journalism.  Always ask questions. Be skeptical and know the difference between PR and the news. Listen to people around you, watch what is happening, and take notes. You never know what line of random curiosity could end up being a story. This course also involves heavy reading and writing – in and out of the classroom.  Reading is the key to being a good writer. If you want a career in journalism you need to consistently read good journalism.

Interviewing your sources can be uncomfortable and awkward at times. But once you get over your initial fear of approaching strangers, you'll find that many people are more than willing to tell you their stories. Reporting also takes time, so give yourself that time. Waiting until the day of deadline is too late. I won’t be able to help at the last minute, and neither will your sources.

Hard work alone will not get you a decent grade, particularly if your hard work was pursued along faulty lines. Let me know if you need additional clarification or guidance. You can e-mail, call, talk to me after class, or come to office hours. I can help if I know what obstacles you’re facing. The end of the semester is too late. Talk to me early and often. This is your class! Make the most of it!

Services for Students with Disabilities
If you believe you need accommodations for a disability, please contact Student Access Services (SAS). In accordance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, qualified individuals with disabilities will not be discriminated against in any programs, or services available at Hofstra University. 
Individuals with disabilities are entitled to accommodations designed to facilitate full access to all programs and services. SAS is responsible for coordinating disability-related accommodations and will provide students with documented disabilities accommodation letters, as appropriate. 
Please note that accommodations may require early planning and are not retroactive; please contact SAS as soon as possible. All students are responsible for providing accommodation letters to each instructor and for discussing with him or her the specific accommodations needed and how they can be best implemented in each course. For more information on services provided by the university and for submission of documentation, please contact Student Access Services, 107 Student Center, 516-463-7075 
Undergraduate course
INC (Incomplete): When requested by the student, the instructor may grant, at her/his discretion, a grade of Incomplete (‘I’). An ‘I’ grade should be given only when unforeseen circumstances prevent the student from completing course work on time. As part of the normal final-grade process, the instructor must submit an ‘I’ grade on-line to the Office of Academic Records with a default grade, the grade the student will receive if the missing work is not completed.  Please refer to the online bulletin of undergraduate grades for the entire University policy and procedure for incomplete grades.

Attendance Policy
Attending class and arriving on time will be important to your grade. There are NO grace days; every day counts for attendance. Attendance will be taken at the start of class and will count toward the participation component of your grade.  Excused absences are granted at the discretion of the professor. Absences are not an excuse for late work. Even if you are absent, you are expected to hand in work on time.
Academic Honesty:
Hofstra University places high value upon educating students about academic honesty.  At the same time, the University will not tolerate dishonesty, and it will not offer the privileges of the community to the repeat offender. It is your responsibility to know what plagiarism is and how to avoid it.  If you don’t understand what plagiarism is and how you can avoid it, you have options.   For further information about policies and procedures concerning violations of academic honesty, consult Faculty Policy Series # 11 in Hofstra’s Guide to Pride and at the University Senate Web site (http://www.hofstra.edu/pdf/Faculty/Senate/senate_FPS_11.pdf).  I also encourage students to take advantage of structured opportunities to learn about academic honesty such as workshops offered by the Center for Teaching and Scholarly Excellence or by the Writing Center. If I have reason to believe you have plagiarized, you will fail the course and be reported to the Provost’s Office and Dean of Students.

Distinguished Speakers: Each semester, the Department of Journalism, Media Studies and Public Relations invites prominent journalists to speak at the School of Communication. Journalism majors are required to attend these lectures, which take place in Breslin Hall during Common Hour, and other times and locations as sanctioned by the School of Communication.

Deadlines: Reporters must meet deadlines. Nothing is more useless that an article on a breaking story written two days late. In the real world, late copy doesn’t get posted or printed. In our world, late assignments aren’t read or graded. No exceptions! Assignments are due at the start of class on the date listed on the syllabus. Readings for each day should be completed before class.

Accuracy: All stories must be entirely accurate. All quotes must be exact. Names must be spelled correctly. If you are not sure, go back and check. Then check again.

Class Participation: Reporters need to be active, not passive. They need to ask questions and challenge what they are told, even if a professor is the one dishing out the talk. Practice these skills in class.

Reading: Most communication professionals read many newspapers, news sites, and blogs each day. The more you read during the semester, the better journalist or public relations professional you’ll become. Read everything you can get your hands on. Keep up with local, national, and international events. Diversify your source of news: don't just rely on your Facebook feed, but see what's trending on Twitter, watch local news, visit aggregator sites, or compare stories on national media outlets.

Grading criteria: Your work will be evaluated according to its publishable quality. The criteria are as follows:
•	A: Outstanding. Publishable quality. Excellent content, ideas, writing, reporting and adherence to AP style.
•	B: Very good. Publishable with minor changes. Good content, reporting and writing skills and adherence to AP style.
•	C: Average. Requires substantial changes (additional information gathering or major rewriting including correction of numerous style errors).
•	D: Poor. Assignment had fundamental problems – weak content, serious writing flaws.
•	F: Unacceptable for any of these reasons: late, inaccurate, incomprehensible, factual errors or misspelled names. Plagiarism automatically results in an F.

Grading percentages:
Assignments: 75% (three major assignments worth 25% each)
•	Individual project, Social story
•	Group project, Visual story
•	Individual project, Data story

Each story is further subdivided as follows:
•	pitch 20%
•	rough 30%
•	final 50%
Students may revise their story one time, and the revision may raise the final grade up one letter grade. Therefore, while revisions are critical to polish your story, you cannot rely on your revision grade to make up for failures in your pitch, rough, or final deliverables.

Class participation/attendance/professionalism/quizzes: 25%

Visual Story
Based on one specific newsworthy pitch approved by the professor. Final multimedia package must contain:
1) A text story that is no longer than 300 words, with embedded hyperlinks to other sources. In other words, tight and bright, and answer the main questions: What is happening and why do I care? You must include quotes from sources.
2) A strong, visually-striking header image
3) A compelling, SEO-conscious headline
4) Reporting from at least two sources

And at least two of these three elements:
1) An edited video no longer than two minutes.
2) A package of 5-10 photos/animated GIFs with captions, either separately or as a slideshow
3) An audio slideshow no longer than two minutes with natural sound and interviews

Social Story
Based on one specific newsworthy pitch approved by the professor. Final multimedia package must contain:
1) A text story that is no longer than 300 words, with embedded hyperlinks to other sources. In other words, tight and bright, and answer the main questions: What is happening and why do I care? You must include quotes from sources.
2) A strong, visually-striking header image
3) A compelling, SEO-conscious headline
4) Reporting from at least two sources

And at least two of these three elements:
1) Multiple embedded sources from social media (tweets, Instagram posts, etc.)
2) A story pitch that was generated from social media.
3) Crowd-sourced information used effectively in your story.

Data Story
Based on one specific newsworthy pitch approved by the professor. Final multimedia package must contain:
1) A text story that is no longer than 300 words at most, with embedded hyperlinks to other sources. In other words: Tight and bright, and answer the main questions: What is happening and why do I care? Must include quotes from sources and be a relevant news topic.
2) A strong, visually-striking header image
3) A compelling, SEO-conscious headline
4) Reporting from at least two sources

And at least two of these three elements:
1) An interactive map.
2) A chart.
3) An interactive/searchable table

Pitch Memo
For each story, you will be required to submit a pitch memo that details the story that you want to tell. The pitch memo answers three crucial questions: (1) What is the story and why should I care? (2) What is the news hook/currency? And (3) Who are your sources? Answering these questions means that you need to do some pre-reporting to find your characters, experts, and other stakeholders. The pitch helps an editor evaluate the newsworthiness of a potential story and helps him/her determine if it is actually doable given the sources cited.

Source List
Each of your stories must be accompanied by a source list, which details the full names and contact information (phone/e-mail) of all the sources that you have contacted and used in your story. The source list provides a way for an editor to verify the accuracy of your reporting and use of quotes in your writing.

Final Notes
•	Must be posted as a draft on the blog site the date it’s due, no later
•	All items need to be crisp and clear on the blog site – no random HTML, no random link postings, no disorderly work. The executive entails providing a crisp and clear presentation on your blog. (Think big digital audience)
•	Must include all parts or substantial points will be taken off
•	Must be clear, concise with a pre-approved topic
•	AP-style. Please copyedit all your text (captions, text, graphs, titlecards, lower-thirds)

Twitter: Every student is required to have a Twitter account for this class. It can be an existing one, one just for this class, or one you feel comfortable using as your “journalism” account.

Tools: You should try and get your hands on a digital camera, memory card and audio recorder. If you cannot get one, the university allows you to rent these items.

Writing Center: Students with inadequate grammar and basic writing skills will be referred to the Writing Center for more help.
