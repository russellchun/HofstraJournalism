Overview

New technology is reshaping the media landscape daily. Journalism has evolved from the typewriter and telegraph days to an age of instantaneous communication, where news is more conversation than information presentation. In this course, students will be introduced to and learn the use of modern journalism tools and concepts including Web publishing with content management systems (CMS), digital photography, audio and video editing, and storytelling with data and social media.
Journalists in the multimedia age need a variety of skills and tools to effectively report, tell, and promote their stories to the public and succeed in the profession. The journalism program aims to make sure students are exposed to the skills they will need in multimedia journalism early in the program and then go on to master them in specialized classes, which will explore and use the tools more in-depth. This class is an introductory class, which will set students on that path.

Students who go through the Journalism Tools class will become familiar with a variety of technical methods of gathering and disseminating news stories. The class is not expected to give students a mastery of any one tool, but instead will expose them to the variety of tools available for their use in journalistic story telling. Students will learn the basics of gathering information through interviews, covering events, record searches, and other online sources. They will also be introduced to the use of audio recorders, still digital photography and videography and their use in newsgathering. The ethics of their uses will also be explored. Understanding news methods with mobile technology and various social media platforms will also play a major role in the class.

This is not a course where you'll simply absorb reading and lecture material and demonstrate your knowledge retention on a final exam. This course is primarily about practicing the craft of journalism, and as such, you will be reporting, writing, and creating media on a regular basis.

Being a journalist

Curiosity is essential to good journalism.  Always ask questions. Be skeptical and know the difference between PR and news. Listen to people around you, watch what is happening and take notes. You never know what line of random curiosity could end up being a story. This course also involves heavy reading and writing – in and out of the classroom.  Reading is the key to being a good writer. If you want a career in journalism you need to consistently read good journalism.

Interviewing your sources can be uncomfortable and awkward at times. But once you get over your initial fear of approaching strangers, you'll find that many people are more than willing to tell you their stories. Reporting also takes time, so give yourself that time. Waiting until the day of deadline is too late. I won’t be able to help at the last minute, and neither will your sources.

Hard work alone will not get you a decent grade, particularly if your hard work was pursued along faulty lines. Let me know if you need additional clarification or guidance. You can e-mail, call, talk to me after class, or come to office hours. I can help if I know what obstacles you’re facing. The end of the semester is too late. Talk to me early and often. This is your class! Make the most of it!

Services for Students with Disabilities
If you believe you need accommodations for a disability, please contact Student Access Services (SAS). In accordance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, qualified individuals with disabilities will not be discriminated against in any programs, or services available at Hofstra University. 
Individuals with disabilities are entitled to accommodations designed to facilitate full access to all programs and services. SAS is responsible for coordinating disability-related accommodations and will provide students with documented disabilities accommodation letters, as appropriate. 
Please note that accommodations may require early planning and are not retroactive; please contact SAS as soon as possible. All students are responsible for providing accommodation letters to each instructor and for discussing with him or her the specific accommodations needed and how they can be best implemented in each course. For more information on services provided by the university and for submission of documentation, please contact Student Access Services, 107 Student Center, 516-463-7075 
Undergraduate course
INC (Incomplete): When requested by the student, the instructor may grant, at her/his discretion, a grade of Incomplete (‘I’). An ‘I’ grade should be given only when unforeseen circumstances prevent the student from completing course work on time. As part of the normal final-grade process, the instructor must submit an ‘I’ grade on-line to the Office of Academic Records with a default grade, the grade the student will receive if the missing work is not completed.  Please refer to the online bulletin of undergraduate grades for the entire University policy and procedure for incomplete grades.
Academic Honesty:
Hofstra University places high value upon educating students about academic honesty.  At the same time, the University will not tolerate dishonesty, and it will not offer the privileges of the community to the repeat offender. It is your responsibility to know what plagiarism is and how to avoid it.  If you don’t understand what plagiarism is and how you can avoid it, you have options.   For further information about policies and procedures concerning violations of academic honesty, consult Faculty Policy Series # 11 in Hofstra’s Guide to Pride and at the University Senate Web site (http://www.hofstra.edu/pdf/Faculty/Senate/senate_FPS_11.pdf).  I also encourage students to take advantage of structured opportunities to learn about academic honesty such as workshops offered by the Center for Teaching and Scholarly Excellence or by the Writing Center. If I have reason to believe you have plagiarized, you will fail the course and be reported to the Provost’s Office and Dean of Students.

Distinguished Speakers: Each semester, the Department of Journalism, Media Studies and Public Relations invites prominent journalists to speak at the School of Communication. Journalism majors are required to attend these lectures, which take place in Breslin Hall during Common Hour, and other times and locations as sanctioned by the School of Communication.

Deadlines: Reporters must meet deadlines. Nothing is more useless that an article on a breaking story written two days late. In the real world, late copy doesn’t get posted or printed. In our world, late assignments aren’t read or graded. No exceptions! Assignments are due at the start of class on the date listed on the syllabus. Readings for each day should be completed before class.

Accuracy: All stories must be entirely accurate. All quotes must be exact. Names must be spelled correctly. If you are not sure, go back and check. Then check again.

Class Participation: Reporters need to be active, not passive. They need to ask questions and challenge what they are told, even if a professor is the one dishing out the talk. Practice these skills in class.

ATTENDANCE POLICY
Attending class and arriving on time will be important to your grade. There are NO grace days; every day counts for attendance. Attendance will be taken at the start of class and will count toward the participation component of your grade.  Excused absences are granted at the discretion of the professor. Absences are not an excuse for late work. Even if you are absent, you are expected to hand in work on time.

Reading: Most communication professionals read many newspapers, news sites, and blogs each day. The more you read during the semester, the better journalist or public relations professional you’ll become. Read everything you can get your hands on. Keep up with local, national, and international events. Diversify your source of news: don't just rely on your Facebook feed, but see what's trending on Twitter, watch local news, visit aggregator sites, or compare stories on national media outlets.

Text books
*Journalism Next: A Practical Guide to Digital Reporting and Publishing, Mark Briggs, CQ Press
*Associated Press Stylebook: Many reporters prefer the spiral bound version, which opens flat, but any edition is fine. If you prefer, you can subscribe to the Stylebook online.  A used, older edition is fine.

Quizzes: Occasionally, there will be short quizzes on your readings. Some may be announced, and some may not. Your quiz performance will count toward your participation grade, and will ensure that you are keeping up with the work.

Grading criteria: Your work will be evaluated according to its publishable quality. The criteria are as follows:
•	A: Outstanding. Publishable quality. Excellent content, ideas, writing, reporting and adherence to AP style.
•	B: Very good. Publishable with minor changes. Good content, reporting and writing skills and adherence to AP style.
•	C: Average. Requires substantial changes (additional information gathering or major rewriting including correction of numerous style errors).
•	D: Poor. Assignment had fundamental problems – weak content, serious writing flaws.
•	F: Unacceptable for any of these reasons: late, inaccurate, incomprehensible, factual errors or misspelled names. Plagiarism automatically results in an F.

Grading percentages:
Assignments: 60% (five major assignments worth 15% each)
•	Social Media story/Live Tweet/Blog
•	Photo gallery/slide show
•	Video story
•	Data visualization story

Final project: 30%
Class participation/attendance/professionalism: 10%

Final: Complete online news package
Based on one specific newsworthy pitch approved by the professor. Final multimedia package must contain:
1) A text story that is no longer than 300 words at most, with embedded hyperlinks to other sources. In other words: Tight and bright, and answer the main questions: What is happening and why do I care? Must include quotes from sources and be a relevant news topic.
2) A strong, visually-striking header image
3) A compelling, SEO-conscious headline

And at least three of these four elements:

1) An edited video no longer than two minutes. It must have at least one recorded quote from a source
2) A package of 5-10 photos with captions, either separately or as a slideshow
3) Citation of data and/or a graph to put story in broader context
4) Embedded links to social media that diversify your sources

Final Notes
•	Must be linked from your blog site the date it’s due, no later
•	All items need to be crisp and clear on the blog site – no random HTML, no random link postings, no disorderly work. The executive entails providing a crisp and clear presentation on your blog. (Think big digital audience)
•	Must include all parts or substantial points will be taken off
•	Must be clear, concise with a pre-approved topic
•	AP-style. Please copyedit all your text (captions, text, graphs, titlecards, lower-thirds)
•	A goal here is to provide you with one in-depth story told with complementary media that you can present future employers for jobs or internships

Blog site: The core of this course, and where all of your projects and assignments will reside, is a personal blog site that each of you will create. We will be using WordPress.com as the tool for creating your personal blog sites. Essentially, each of you will be creating a personal news website that you will populate with news stories that will become increasingly rich and complex as the semester progresses and we learn more skills. 

Twitter: Every student is required to have a Twitter account for this class. It can be an existing one, one just for this class, or one you feel comfortable using as your “journalism” account.

Tools: You should try and get your hands on a digital camera, memory card and audio recorder. If you cannot get one, the university allows you to rent these items.

Writing Center: Students with inadequate grammar and basic writing skills will be referred to the Writing Center for more help.

Class structure: When we can, we’ll make the first class of the week a lesson and the second class a workshop to conquer the previously learned lesson. The point of a journalism class is to learn and to put your knowledge to the test. We’ll be going out of the classroom, roaming around campus and being journalists as much as we can in JRNL 10.

Editor’s Note: Many of you have never produced a digital media story before, never used a style guide, never conducted an interview, and perhaps never read a newspaper. You will learn all these skills over the course of the semester, but at first you are apt to feel overwhelmed. Work hard, hang in there and, please, ask for help whenever necessary. Contact me with questions. I want you to succeed.
